# BBCNewsLabs

This is a coding excercise for BBC News Labs. It contains a locally hosted API running on localHost:8080. The 
API is able to parse unformatted JSON scripts and output the script in properly formatted JSON format. 

It consists of an API for submitting POST requests and follows RESTful API principles. 

The address of the API is:

        localhost:8080/scriptParser
        
Please submit POST requests containing the body of the JSON to be formatted. For more information, please read the API documentation PDF contained within the project folder.
